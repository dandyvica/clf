# Reimplementation of the *check_logfiles* Nagios plugin

*Warning*: this is under construction and might change in the future.

## Nagios check_logfiles
If you're familiar with Nagios plugins, you probably should be aware of its *check_logfiles* one. It allows to scan files (generally log files generated by UNIX daemons or Windows services) for different patterns. Each time a pattern is matched, an external script is called, along with arguments like captures groups.

The plug-in uses configuration files, which are plain *Perl* language regular files. These are imported by the *check_logfiles* script and uses them internally.

You can find the *check_logfiles* plugin here: https://labs.consol.de/nagios/check_logfiles/

## Implementation in Rust
While *Perl* is one of the fastest interpreted language, nothing can beat a compiled executable, specially when developed with a non-garbage collected one like C, C++ or Rust. When dealing with lots of servers in a professional environment, execution speed, memory footprint and scalability are paramount.

Rust is a relatively new system's programming language, providing speed, and security at compile time. For an introduction to Rust, please refer to https://www.rust-lang.org/ .

This reimplementation in Rust aims at solving original *check_logfiles* drawbacks:

* straightforward distribution: a single executable is needed. Using the *musl* static binary, no need for a specific verison of *libc*.
* enhanced portability: same behaviour between Windows, Linux or BSD-like operating systems.
* lightning speed: with an execution speed comparable to C or C++, execution time is not a hurdle.
* ability to either call an external script or send JSON data coming from logfile to a TCP stream or a UNIX domain stream.
* standard configuration file format: opposite to the original *check_logfiles* with uses non-standard configuration files (regular *Perl* files containing *Perl* variables), this implementation uses the YAML format for its configuration files. YAML is best suited comparing to JSON or XML because there's no need to escape chars for regexes expressions.
* versatility: coupled with *Jinja2*-like well-known templates, you can imagine lots of possibilities to manage configuration files in a professionnal environment.
* power: it will take into account not only regular log files, but also list of files command from a shell command or a script.
* no need for a decompression binary: logfiles are *gunzipped* out of the box. Supported formats: gzip (extension: .gz), bzip2 (extension: .bz2), xz (extension: .xz)
* search for current or archived log files.
* manage log rotations
* UTF-8 ready by default

*Caveat*: Even though the current ```regex``` Rust crate is providing fast regexes checks, it doesn't currently support _lookahead or lookbehind_ patterns.

## Releases
Current release is 0.8 and currently still in a testing phase.

## Principle of operation
The *clf* executable processing is simple. After reading the YAML configuration file passed to the command line, it reads each logfile (or a list of logfiles provided by an external command or script) and tests each line against the defined regexes. If a match is found, it triggers an external script, either by spawning a new process and providing a set of environment variables to this process (and optionnally updating the *PATH* or *Path* variable, depending on the OS). Or by establishing a new socket connection to a remote address and port configured in the configuration file, and sending a JSON data structure with a set of variables coming from the search. Or even to a UNIX domain socket with the same principle.

The plugin output and exit code is depending on what is found in the provided logfiles.

## Format of the YAML configuration file
The current format of the configuration file defines where and what to search is a standard YAML format. 

Following is a list of current tags defined in the configuration file:

```yaml
---
# a list of global options, valid for all searches.
global:
  # a list of ':'-separated list of paths (UNIX) or ';'-separated (Windows). If provided, the script is
  # searched within those directories.

  # platform.
  script_path: "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

  # a path & file name where clf is keeping its runtime information. This is used to restart the search from the last
  # offset reached from the last clf run.

## Detailed YAML configuration tags
Each tag in the YAML file could be set to specify a feature. A tag can be eith optional or mandatory.

tag name | mandatory? | description
---                        | --- | --- 
global       | no  |  a list of options, which are set globally for all defined searches
path         | no Â |  This path will be searched for spawning the external script, if the provided script path is relative. Will defaults to '/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin' for Unix, or 'C:\Windows\system32;C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32\Wbem;' for Windows.               
snapshot_file              | no  | a file which will keep runtime data. If not present, defaults to '/tmp/clf_snapshot.json' on Unix, or any temporary Windows directory plus 'clf_snapshot.json'
snapshot_retention         | no  | number of seconds after which runtime data will be deleted from snapshot file, for a specific tag. 0 means keep forever, default is ??
global_vars                  | no  | a YAML list of user-defined variables. These will be provided as environment variables, prefixed with 'CLF_', to the called script
searches    | yes | a list of data defining where to search for, what to search for, and which action to trigger on a match
logfile     | yes | the path to the logfile to search for. If defined as a relative path, it'll be relative to the current directory
process     | no  | set it to *false* if you don't want to process the logfile. Defaults to *true* if not present
tags        | yes | a YAML list of structures, defining what to search
name        | yes | a label to refer to for this search
options     | no | a list of options specific to a tag and controlling how search is managed. See below for a complete list of possible options
script      | no | a definition of an external script to call, whenever a match is found in the logfile
path        | yes | the absolute or relative path to the external script
args        | no | a YAML list of optional arguments, given to the external script when called
patterns    | yes | a list of either warning or critical regexes, which are tested to match for each line
---

The way *clf* searches in logfiles is controlled, for each tag, by a list of comma-separated options. Some are only boolean options, soem others require to be set using an equality:

option | description
--- | ---
runcallback              | if set, the defined callback will be call for each line where a *critical* or *warning* pattern matches
rewind                   | if set, *clf* will read the considered logfile from the beginning, bypassing any offset recorded in the *snapshot* file
fastforward              | move to the end of the file, don't call any callback, if no snapshot data is found for the logfile
criticalthreshold=<u64>  | when set to a 8-byte positive integer value, it means that critical errors will not be triggered unless this threshold is reached
warningthreshold=<u64>   | when set to a 8-byte positive integer value, it means that warning errors will not be triggered unless this threshold is reached
savethresholds           | when set, either critical or warning threshold will be save in the *snapshot* file
runlimit=<u64>           | when set, for each execution of *clf*, the defined script (if any) will only be called at most the value set by this option
truncate=<u16>          | before matching any regex on a line, truncate the line to the specified number
runifok                 | if set, any defined callback is called even in case of an OK pattern found
stopat=<u64>            | stop searching patterns when line number reaches the specified value

If a boolean option is not defined, it defaults to *false*. For integer options, they default to the maximum integer possible.

## Callback definition
A callback is either 
* a script which is called with environement variables depending on what is found during the search
* a TCP ip address to which data found are sent through a JSON string
* a UNIX domain socket (UNIX only) to which data found are sent through a JSON string

Examples of callbacks:

A script callback:
```yaml
callback: 
  script: ./tests/integration/scripts/echovars.py
  args: ['/tmp/echovars.txt', 'arg2', 'arg3']
```
A TCP callback:
```yaml
callback: 
  address: 127.0.0.1:8999
  args: ['arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3']
```
A UNIX domain socket callback:
```yaml
callback: 
  domain: /tmp/clfdomain.sock
  args: ['arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3']
```

It's better to use the TCP or UDS callbacks because there's no overhead spawning an executable when matching lots of lines in a logfile. In case of a TCP or UDS callback, the receiving address or domain must be started before handling data from *clf*.

## Patterns definition
When *clf* fetches a line from a logfile, it compares this string with a list of *critical* regexes defined in the configuration file first, if any. Then it moves to comparing with a list of *warning* regexes if any. Ultimately, it compares with a list of *ok* patterns. This latter comparison makes *clf* to reset ongoing threshold to 0.

For *critical* or *warning* patterns, a list of exceptions can be defined, which invalidate any previous triggered match.

It is mandatory to use single quotes when using regexes, because it doesn't incur escaping characters. 

> Note: the current Rust *regex* crate doesn't support lookahead/lookbehind patterns. This can be alleviated using the *execptions* list, specially for negation regexes.

## Getting a list of files instead of a single one
Using the *loglist* YAML tag, it's possible to get a list of files. Following is an example for Windows & Linux:

```yaml
# example of a UNIX command, which returns a list of files
- loglist: { 
    cmd: 'find',
    args: ['/var/log', "-maxdepth", "1", "-type", "f", "-name", "[a-d]*.log"]
  }
```

```yaml
# example of a Windows command, which returns a list of files
- loglist: { 
    cmd: 'cmd.exe',
    args: ['/c', 'dir c:\windows\system32\*.log /s /a /b']
  }
```

## Environment provided to the called scripts or commands
Whenever a match is found when searching a logfile, if provided, a script is called, with optional arguments. A list of environment variables is created and passed to the created process, to be used by the called script. Following is the list of created variables:

variable name | description
---                                | --- 
CLF_LOGFILE                        | logfile name
CLF_CONFIG_FILE                    | configuration file name
CLF_HOSTNAME                       | machine hostname
CLF_PLATFORM                       | platform name
CLF_USER                           | user running *clf*
CLF_TAG                            | tag name
CLF_LINE                           | full line from the logfile, which triggered the match
CLF_LINE_NUMBER                    | the line number in the logfile, which triggered the match
CLF_MATCHED_RE                     | the regex (as a string) which triggered the match
CLF_MATCHED_RE_TYPE                | the type of regex which riggered the match (critical or warning)
CLF_CG_n                           | the value of the capture group involved in the match (n >= 0). Only in case of unnamed capture groups
CLF_NB_CG                          | number of capture groups
CLF_cgname                         | the value of the name capture group involved in the match
CLF_uservar1                       | the value of a user-defined variables defines in the *global:* YAML tag
CLF_OK_COUNT                       | current number of OK patterns found
CLF_WARNING_COUNT                  | current number of WARNING patterns found
CLF_CRITICAL_COUNT                 | current number of CRITICAL patterns found

You could easily gain access to those variables in scripting languages:

* Python: using the ```os.environ``` object, like this:

```python
import os
{ v:os.environ.get(v) for v in os.environ if v.startswith("CLF_") }

```

* Ruby: 

```ruby
ENV.select { |k,v| k.start_with?("CLF_") }
```

* bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for v in ${!CLF_*}
do
    echo $v
done
```

## List of command-line arguments
A self-explanatory help can be used with:

```console
clf --help
```
or

```console
clf -h
```

Following is a list of cli arguments:

```
USAGE:
    clf [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --config <config>

FLAGS:
    -d, --delete-snapshot
            Delete snapshot file before searching

    -h, --help
            Prints help information

    -a, --no-callback

            matching line. Used to check whether regexes are correct

    -r, --overwrite-log
            Overwrite clf log if specified

    -o, --show-options
            Just show the command line options passed and exit

    -w, --show-rendered
            Render the configuration file through Jinja2/Tera and exit. This is meant to check Tera
            substitutions

            3.[possible values: 2, 3]

    -p, --snapshot <snapshot>
            Override the snapshot file specified in the configuration file. It will default to the
            platform-dependent name using the temporary directory if not provided in configuration
            file or by using this flag

    -v, --var <var>...
            An optional variable to send to the defined callback. Multiple values are possible


```

## Plugin output
Here is an example of plugin output:

```
CRITICAL - (errors:662, warnings:28, unknowns:2)
tests/logfiles/small_access.log.gz: No such file or directory (os error 2)
/var/log/dpkg.log: OK - (errors:0, warnings:0, unknowns:0)

/var/log/alternatives.log: OK - (errors:0, warnings:0, unknowns:0)
```

## Compiling *clf*
Using the standard *cargo* command:

```console
$ cargo build --release
```

To compile with the *musl* library as a standalone static executable:

```
$ cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --release   
```

## Windows specifics
In order to emulate UNIX inode/dev features, a specific DLL has been developed (*signature.dll*) You need to put this DLL in one of the paths specified by the Windows *Path* environment variable.
