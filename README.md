# Implementation of the check_logfiles Nagios plugin

## Nagios check_logfiles
If you're familiar with Nagios plugin, you probably should be aware of its *check_logfiles* one. It allows to scan files (generally log files generated by UNIX daemons or Windows services) for different patterns. Each time a pattern is matched, an external script is called, along with arguments like captures groups.

The plug-in uses confuguration files, which are plain *Perl* language regular files. These are imported by the *check_logfiles* script and uses internally

You can find the *check_logfiles* plugin here: https://labs.consol.de/nagios/check_logfiles/

## Implementation in Rust
While *Perl* is one of the fastest interpreted lnaguage, nothing can beat a compiled executable, specially when developed with a non-garbage collected one like C, C++ or Rust. When dealing with lots of servers in a professional environment, execution speed, memory footprint and scalability are paramount.

Rust is a relatively new system's programming language, providing speed, and security at compile time. For an introduction to Rust, refer to https://www.rust-lang.org/ .

This future reimplementation in Rust aims at solving original *check_logfiles* flaws:

* distribution: a single executable is needed
* portability: same behaviour between Windows, Linux or BSD-like operating systems
* speed: with an execution speed comparable to C or C++, execution time is not a hurdle. Multi-threaded or async/await is a target
* standard configuration file format: opposite to the original *cehck_logfiles* with uses non-standard files, this implementation will use YAML for its configuration files. YAML is best suited comparing to JSON or XML because there's no need to escape chars for regexes expressions
* versatility: coupled with *Jinja2*-like well-known templates, you can imagine lots of possibilities to manage configuration files in a professionnal environment
* power: it will take into account not only regular log files, but also list of files command from a shell command or a script
* no need for a decompression binary: logfiles are *gunzipped* out of the box
* search for current or archived log files

## Releases

Current release is 0.1 and currently in development. It should be considered as bleeding edge or pre-Î± stage.
